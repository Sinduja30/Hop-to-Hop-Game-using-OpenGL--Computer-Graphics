This was my mini-project at college
It an game built using C language in OpenGL IDE, in this game the player will select characters i.e either spiderman or superman at the beginning of the game.
Then the player has to cross the road filled with obstacles like vehicles etc. and land on the opposite grid lane.
Depending upon the platform in which he lands trophies are awarded i.e Gold, Silver and Bronze.
------Feel free to ask me any questions about this if required, i'd be happy to help-------
